# 2D game engine for mario
Developed as part of a tutorial by GameswithGabe on freeCodeCamp, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in graphics programming. Leveraging my recent knowledge of Java acquired during college, I created a 2D game engine to gain a deeper understanding of game development concepts. Please note that this engine is a learning project and is not intended for production use.
